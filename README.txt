Spotify Global Trends Analysis- Function Library
Course: INST326: Object-Oriented Programming for Information Science
Section: 0203
Team: Information Retrieval
Team Members: Vivian Dao, Fatimah Shaw, Christiana Crabbe, Vince Baluis

## Project Overview
This function library will contain different functions that will retrieve data from a csv file and extract track metadata, clean and normalize the data, write queries using SQLite in Python to compare music genres, artists, and popularity, and show our findings with bar charts using Matplotlib in Python.

The Problem
-Spotify tends only to recommend familiar artists and genres to listeners
-There is a lack of exposure for local and regional artists worldwide

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Spotify-Global-Trends-Information-Retrieval-.git
   cd garden-management-library
